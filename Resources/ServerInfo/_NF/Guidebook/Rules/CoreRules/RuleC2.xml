[color=#FFD700][head=3]Section 2: GOLDEN Rules[/head][/color] 

[color=#FFD700]1.1[/color] We're all adults here, and if you have a certain idea you want to do with other players, the best place to arrange it, is at the outpost! The outpost is like an OOC zone, so you can freely approach and use LOOC to come up with ideas if not done in OOC already. Players aren't forced to fight, and they aren't forced to be victims either. We're all here to have fun, and you can choose not to take part in certain aspects despite what's allowed above.

[color=#FFD700]1.2[/color] Communicate if something isn't what you want it to be! Using arepee-planning on the discord is also one way to go about it, so don't be shy to try out ideas with other people. 

[color=#FFD700]1.3[/color] For example, if you want to have a skirmish without removing each other, or one of the ships entirely, could even ask an admin to make sure the involved parties are healed after the conflict, allowing story progression without crippling consequences, provided it is what they'd like! How you play it out is your way, could consider it ICly being re-cloned, or being shipped in as a new member!
